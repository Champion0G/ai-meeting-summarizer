# Demo Link Status Check

## Your Demo URL:
**https://champion0g.github.io/meeting-summarizer/**

## To Make It Work:

### 1. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/champion0g/meeting-summarizer.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages:
1. Go to: https://github.com/champion0g/meeting-summarizer/settings/pages
2. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: **main**
4. Folder: **/docs**
5. Click **Save**

### 3. Wait 2-5 minutes:
GitHub Pages takes a few minutes to deploy. You'll see a green checkmark when ready.

## Troubleshooting:

**If demo link shows 404:**
- Make sure you've pushed to GitHub
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled with `/docs` folder
- Wait a few minutes for deployment

**If demo shows blank page:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- Verify the `docs/` folder has the built React app

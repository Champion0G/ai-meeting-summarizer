Meeting: Weekly Team Standup
Date: January 15, 2025
Attendees: John Smith (PM), Sarah Johnson (Dev), Mike Chen (Designer), Lisa Wang (QA)

John: Good morning everyone. Let's start with our weekly standup. Sarah, can you give us an update on the user authentication feature?

Sarah: Sure. I've completed the login and registration functionality. The JWT token implementation is working well. I'm currently working on password reset functionality, which should be done by Thursday. One blocker - I need the email templates from Mike for the reset emails.

Mike: I can get those to you by tomorrow morning. I've been working on the new dashboard design. The wireframes are complete and I've started on the high-fidelity mockups. I'll have the first version ready for review by Wednesday.

Lisa: From QA perspective, I've finished testing the previous sprint's features. Found 3 minor bugs in the profile update section, already logged them in Jira. I'll start testing Sarah's authentication work once it's ready for QA environment.

John: Great progress everyone. A few action items from this meeting:
- Mike to send email templates to Sarah by tomorrow
- Sarah to complete password reset by Thursday
- Lisa to begin auth testing once deployed to QA
- Team demo scheduled for Friday at 2 PM

Any blockers or concerns? 

Sarah: Just waiting on those email templates, otherwise I'm good.

Mike: No blockers on my end.

Lisa: All good here.

John: Perfect. Let's reconvene same time next week. Thanks everyone!
